I bring a strong background in data analytics and business intelligence and am now moving into cybersecurity. Over the past year, I have been developing practical security analysis skills through hands-on projects, certifications, and applied work with security datasets, with a growing focus on SOC operations, security analytics, and risk assessment.

# Career Focus

Currently I am aiming to contribute as a SOC analyst /cybersecurity analyst where I can apply analytical skills to monitor, investigate, and respond to security events while strengthening organizational defenses.
